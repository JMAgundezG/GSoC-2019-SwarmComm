# Development of examples of swarm communications using RoboComp and V-REP simulator





The project consists in develop a verbal and a non-verbal communications scene examples with RoboComp and creating new components that uses V-REP simulator.

## Simulator used

V-REP: [link here](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/)



## Robot model

The official web of the ePuck creators is in [this link](http://www.e-puck.org/)



## Code

These examples are in [this repo](https://github.com/JMAgundezG/gsoc2019). In the README file appears how to execute step by step each example.



## For the following versions

- Improve the Verbal communication example, it's not an scalable code because of his behaviour.
- Improve the CV algorithms in the verbal communication example.

- In the non verbal communication example, it could be better if the communication channel was another component instead of a simulation signal.

- Improve the movement algorithms.
